This new innovation is a testimony to RIL's commitment in reducing plastic waste and supporting Circular Economy in India. RIL shipped its first batch of ISCC-Plus certified Circular Polymers, named CircuRepol‚Ñ¢ (Polypropylene) and CircuRelene‚Ñ¢ (Polyethylene). RIL paves the way in India by using new technology to recycle plastic by converting plastic waste into special Circular Polymers, thereby making a positive impact on the environment. RIL‚Äôs commitment to sustainability is demonstrated through its innovative methods like chemical recycling which help create a Circular Economy. The company firmly believes in finding smart solutions to reduce plastic waste and inspire others to join in this journey towards a greener future. CircuRepol‚Ñ¢ and CircuRelene‚Ñ¢ have been designed to lead the way in Circular Economy practices. RIL's Jamnagar refinery became the first refinery to get the important ISCC-Plus certification, proving that it can produce Circular Polymers through chemical recycling. The ISCC-Plus certification guarantees that traceability and rules are followed in making Circular Polymers. RIL has developed a technology that turns different types of plastic waste, including single use and multi-layered plastics, into pyrolysis oil. The company is working with trusted partners to increase the production of this oil and turn the yield into Circular Polymers. Chemical recycling has many benefits, including turning plastic waste into high-quality materials for new plastic. These materials can be used for packaging that comes into contact with food. #WeCare #RelianceInnovation #CircularEconomy #SustainableFuture",https://www.instagram.com/p/C1b2zUHiZgH/,,,,https://d1cdkkfhgor70g.cloudfront.net/C1b2zUHiZgH?postNativeId=17855772318091399,carousel,,,72,72,0,0,9561,0.007530593034201443,14.292882376358031,,0,0

Here's a look at the milestones achieved: Rapid Expansion: On January 11, Jio announced that its True5G services had reached over 100 cities in just about 100 days since its initial launch in October 2022. By December 15, this number skyrocketed to over 7,764 cities and lakhs of villages, serving over 80 million 5G subscribers. This year, Reliance Jio has not only spearheaded 5G adoption in India but has also positioned the country among the top three globally in terms of 5G capabilities. Leadership in 5G Adoption: Jio's relentless pursuit of innovation has led to the rapid deployment of its cutting-edge True5G network across India. This swift expansion demonstrates not just technical prowess but also a commitment to bridging digital divides, ensuring that India keeps pace with leading 5G-enabled nations. In-House Technological Marvel: A remarkable aspect of Jio‚Äôs 5G rollout is its entirely indigenous technology stack. This 100% homegrown 5G stack, meticulously designed, developed, and manufactured by Indian talent, stands as a testament to India‚Äôs growing expertise and self-reliance in advanced technology sectors. It's a proud moment for the nation, showcasing our capabilities in not just adopting but also creating world-class technology. A Catalyst for National Progress: Jio's 5G technology is more than just a network; it's a catalyst that propels India towards becoming a global technology leader. It paves the way for innovative applications in various sectors like healthcare, education, and industry 4.0, thus playing a critical role in shaping a modern, digitally empowered India. Unprecedented Speed of Deployment: As revealed by Mr. Akash Ambani at the India Mobile Congress 2023, Jio implemented a world-record rollout, deploying a 5G cell every 10 seconds. By October 2023, Jio had installed over 10 lakh 5G cells, accounting for 85% of India's 5G capacity. JioAirFiber Launch: In September 2023, Jio introduced JioAirFiber, aiming to connect over 200 million homes. This initiative uses advanced wireless technologies to replace the need for last-mile fibre, reaching over 500 cities and towns in less than 100 days. Surge in Data Consumption: The rapid rollout of Jio True5G and JioFiber has led to a spike in data consumption, with Jio users consuming 25 GB per month on average. Empowering Digital India: Aligning with the ‚ÄòWeCare‚Äô motto, Jio has taken significant steps to digitally empower millions of unconnected citizens. The launch of the Jio Bharat 4G feature phone at Rs. 999 and JioPhone Prima at Rs. 2,599 marked a significant step towards achieving 'Digital Freedom' for all. Awards and Recognition: Jio's 5G network received global accolades, winning all nine Speed test awards from Ookla in October 2023, a first for any service provider worldwide. This year Jio entered the list of Great Place To Work¬Æ Certified‚Ñ¢ organizations in India. Jio's journey in 2023 is not just about technological dominance but also about creating a digitally inclusive society, ensuring that the benefits of a connected world reach every corner of India. #JioTrue5G #DigitalIndia #TechInnovation #JioAirFiber #WeCare",https://www.facebook.com/502689438663583/posts/689576069974918,,,,https://d1fufsnuanxyqc.cloudfront.net/616466315092212_689576069974918,video,,,256,231,5,20,2286545,0.0001119593097883488,-4.72868652875762,4110,0,0

With a vision for a circular economy, this pilot project, aligned with the Government‚Äôs Swachh Bharat Mission, has commenced in 36 stores of Reliance Retail including Smart Bazaar and Sahakari Bhandar stores in Mumbai and Delhi, and will expand to 200 stores across the country by 2025 with a target of collecting 5,00,000 PET bottles annually in the pilot phase. The initiative was launched in the presence of Kazi Irfan, Officer on Special Duty (OSD), Solid Waste Management, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), at Reliance Retail‚Äôs Smart Bazaar store in Santa Cruz. The installed RVMs and collection bins will give consumers a convenient way to deposit used PET bottles in exchange for compelling discounts on Coca-Cola India products. The disposed PET bottles will be collected and recycled by Reliance Industries (RIL), a leader in the recycling of polyester and plastics. This initiative will facilitate smooth waste collection by engaging consumers in responsible waste management - transitioning away from a traditional linear economy. Speaking on the launch, Mr. Damodar Mall, Chief Executive Officer, Grocery Retail, Reliance Retail Limited, said, ‚ÄúIndian families have had the habit of not trashing milk pouches, plastic bottles, even newspapers, daily. We clean, collect them, and hand them over to raddiwalas, who in today‚Äôs world are the unique front-end army of recyclers. SmartBazaar, as a modern retailer continues to encourage this habit, with modern methods. Our pilot with our store shoppers, with the support of Coca-Cola India and Reliance Industries, is one such attempt we plan to pursue with our wide network of stores.‚Äù Ms. Greishma Singh, Vice President ‚Äì Customer and Commercial Leadership, Coca‚ÄëCola India and Southwest Asia, said, ‚ÄúThrough this partnership and platform, we are delighted that we can generate awareness and provide shoppers a convenient way to recycle their PET bottles while they are shopping at their Reliance store. Partnerships with retail, government, civic societies, and consumer-centric ideas like this one are a powerful multiplier for progress on collection, recycling, and reuse.‚Äù Mr. Hemant D Sharma, President - Growth and Strategy, Polyester, Reliance Industries Limited, said, ‚ÄúReliance stands as a trailblazer in sustainability and circularity, leading India's charge in transforming waste into valuable resources. Recycling 2 billion PET bottles annually, with a plan to scale it to 5 billion, RIL epitomizes a commitment to sustainability that predates current trends and sets the standard for eco-friendly manufacturing. For over two decades, RIL has championed recycling post-consumer PET bottles, demonstrating a foresighted dedication to a greener, circular future.‚Äù This initiative is a key step toward Coca-Cola‚Äôs commitment to collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of the packaging the company produces as part of its World Without Waste strategy. It will act as an anchor, retaining the sustainability momentum activated by Coca-Cola India‚Äôs 'Return and Recycle' initiative in collaboration with Zepto which has witnessed participation from 50,000 households in India and the successful RVM installations across 75 cities in the country, collecting 1 Tonne of PET waste.

The Innovation Hub, the first of its kind for the industry, will focus its first efforts on accelerating the development of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLM) and Open Digital Architecture to benefit the whole industry. Leaders from both organizations and representatives from the Innovation Hub Founding Members including Accenture, Deutsche Telekom, Google Cloud, Orange, Telenor and Vodafone attended the ceremony at the Reliance Corporate IT Park in Navi, Mumbai, where hybrid teams made up of talent from across the telecom and tech industry will collaborate to deliver breakthrough thinking and solutions for the industry‚Äôs most pressing challenges. Mumbai was selected as the location for the first TM Forum Innovation Hub in recognition of India being the epicenter of global software development talent. Its opening builds on the TM Forum‚Äôs long-standing commitment to India ‚Äì where more than 37,000 active Forum member professionals are based. One of the hub‚Äôs first focus areas is the application of Generative AI and LLM to priority use cases for telcos, including developing an architecture blueprint to simplify responsible use of generative AI for brownfield telecoms technology landscapes, including the related challenges of security, privacy, accuracy, performance and scalability. A second focus area will focus on accelerating the development and adoption of TM Forum‚Äôs Open Digital Architecture. ODA underpins the creation of modular, componentized, and reusable cloud-native software to replace traditional BSS and OSS. Objectives include creating Reference Implementation(s) of the ODA Canvasand components, as well as migration patterns and innovative approaches to simplify migration from legacy software to ODA-compliant, cloud-native components. Commenting on the opening of the Innovation Hub: Mr Akash Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited: ‚ÄúThe TM Forum Innovation Hub is about delivering real-world solutions that will change our industry and there is no better way than to lean on talent from across the industry to solve our existing challenges as well as finding better ways to overcome future obstacles. We are delighted to see the first innovation hub open on our Mumbai campusas I believe Mumbai is the perfect location to foster the innovation needed. This is a really exciting time for Jio, TM Forum and the wider telecoms industry and we are honoured to be at the heart of this project.‚Äù Dr. Steffen Roehn, TM Forum Chair and Partner at Bain & Company: ‚ÄúRapid, open collaboration is today more important for our industry‚Äôs future than ever before. The TM Forum Innovation Hub will prove hugely beneficial as our members explore new technologies, more radical approaches to transform their organizations and strengthen their muscles. We‚Äôre delighted to be collaborating closely with Jio and all the founding members on this first Innovation Hub in Mumbai and look forward to seeing the first outcomes from the hub‚Äôs pilot projects.‚Äù Nik Willetts, CEO, TM Forum: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled to see work begin at the first ever TM Forum Innovation Hub here in Navi Mumbai. Our vision is to bring together our industry‚Äôs best talent in a neutral, entrepreneurial environment to rapidly deliver breakthrough thinking and answers to the industry‚Äôs most pressing challenges. The first projects reflect two of the most important areas for rapid innovation: the responsible and effective use of generative AI, and accelerating the pathways to an Open Digital Architecture to drive growth. Our sincere thanks to all of our Innovation Hub founding members ‚Äì and in particular Jio, who have given our first Hub a home.‚Äù The Innovation Hub program was unveiled two months ago at the TM Forum‚Äôs annual DTW ‚Äì Ignite conference in Copenhagen. Founding members Accenture, Deutsche Telekom, Google Cloud, Orange, Reliance Jio, Telenor and Vodafone are all contributing a range of expertise and resources to the hub, including experts, physical space, technology capabilities and professional services. The first Innovation Hub teams will be made up of staff from these organizations working both physically and virtually. The outcomes of Innovation Hub projects will benefit the entire TM Forum membership, and the wider industry in several ways: ¬∑ Providing a new way for the industry to collaborate at speed, solving intractable industry challenges with ‚Äòreal‚Äô results that can be practically implemented ‚Äì including working code or concepts proven at scale in operational or shadow-operational environments ¬∑ Testing and iterating TM Forum standards, providing valuable implementation experience to core standards development teams ¬∑ Accelerating the development of code assets (for example, Open Digital Architecture components and Open APIs) to be contributed towards TM Forum collaboration projects ¬∑ Industrializing concepts explored in the Catalyst program, sharing the learnings with the broader industry The pilot phase of the Innovation Hub program is expected to conclude in March 2024, with a third pilot project starting shortly. TM Forum Members will be invited to apply to join an existing Innovation Hub project or propose a new one in 2024. To be considered to join a project Member companies will need to bring the distinct expertise the project requires, as well as meet the minimum dedicated resource commitment.

One of the ways of addressing the needs of customers is to offer a wider assortment, whether its daily-need or difficult-to-find items. Reliance Consumer Products Limited (RCPL), the FMCG arm of Reliance Retail, kicked off the year by doing just that. In January, it strengthened its beverage portfolio by acquiring a 50% stake in the century old Sosyo Hajoori Beverages and followed it up by bringing Sri Lanka‚Äôs Maliban biscuits to India with the aim of developing new value propositions for the domestic market. Being the official retailer of GAP in India, Reliance Retail in February opened the apparel brand‚Äôs first freestanding store in Mumbai having already launched over 50 shop-in-shops. The next month, however, it was RCPL, which stirred up the domestic beverage market by launching the iconic Campa. By April, things started heating up. Being the country‚Äôs most preferred retailer is by no means an easy task with Indian customers expecting Reliance Retail to offer value and variety in other areas apart from daily essentials and apparel. In stepped Tira, Reliance Retail‚Äôs beauty platform, which apart from launching freestanding stores, reached customers across 100 pin codes through its app. Later that month, Reliance Brands amped up the buzz further by bringing one of UK‚Äôs best-known food chains, Pret A Manger to India. After four months of acquisitions and launches, May promised to be quiet. The team at Reliance Retail, however, had other plans. It completed the Rs 2,850 crore acquisition of German retailer, Metro‚Äôs wholesale business in India with the aim to not only boost its business-to-business (B2B) but help modernize more kirana partners. RCPL, too, jumped on the bandwagon. It purchased 51% stake in Lotus Chocolates, entered the western snacks category by partnering with General Mills to launch Alan‚Äôs Bugles chips in India and in June, took its Independence brand to North India. July witnessed Reliance Brands partnering with FDCI for Hyundai India Couture Week, while in August, one of world‚Äôs top investors, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) showed its faith in India‚Äôs retail growth story by investing $1 billion in Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL) for around 1% stake, nearly doubling the company‚Äôs valuation to $100 billion from its last funding in 2020. In the same month, Reliance Retail launched its youth focused apparel and accessories brand, Yousta. By September, top private equity firm, KKR & Co Inc added to its bet on the country‚Äôs largest retailer by investing an additional $250 million. Subsequently, Reliance Retail picked up 51% stake in Bollywood star, Alia Bhatt‚Äôs kidswear and maternity wear brand, Ed-a-Mamma, while Reliance Retail-owned global toy brand, Hamley‚Äôs opened its first store in the world‚Äôs fashion capital, Milan. Moving into the festive season, October had much to cheer about with Reliance Retail buying the majority rights of UK‚Äôs Superdry IP for the Indian territory. The move was quickly followed by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) investing $598 million in RRVL, valuing it among the top four companies by equity value in India. And to top it all, in what came as good news to thousands of Indian luxury shoppers, Jio World Plaza opened its doors Mumbai. And with the year drawing to a close, AJIO, Reliance Retail‚Äôs fashion e-tailer, in November introduced Ajiogram, India‚Äôs first ever direct-to-consumer (D2C) focused content-driven interactive e-commerce platform to empower startups in the fashion and accessories space. Similarly, Indian artisans and craftspersons had much to cheer about as the company launched the first Swadesh store in Hyderabad with the brand aiming to promote authentic handcrafted products and rich art forms in India and globally. And to carry on the festivities into the new year, the company bagged global beauty chain, Sephora‚Äôs India rights, too. The move is expected to not only bolster the company‚Äôs existing beauty business but offer more options to the burgeoning number of Indian beauty enthusiasts. #RelianceRetail #Rewind2023 #WeCare #RIL",https://www.facebook.com/502689438663583/posts/689607266638465,,,,https://d1fufsnuanxyqc.cloudfront.net/616466315092212_689607266638465,video,,,137,111,15,11,2286545,0.000059915724378921035,-8.841059120264537,1140,0,0

Reliance‚Äôs transition towards Net Zero gained momentum, it became India‚Äôs largest bio-energy firm, it set up a world-class financial services firm, it scaled up gas output to 30% of India‚Äôs production, and also witnessed the next-generation leaders joining the Board of Directors. ‚Ä¢ Through 2023, all three large platforms of Reliance ‚Äì energy and materials, organised retail, and digital services ‚Äì made rapid progress on all the financial and operational parameters reaching new records. Reliance is also focused on the timely execution of its new renewable energy platform. ‚Ä¢ A New Reliance is now emerging as a new-age technology company with distinctive capabilities ‚Äì a net producer of technology, a large-scale deployer of technology, as well as a democratiser of technology. ‚Ä¢ Reliance‚Äôs ceaseless spirit of innovation is aimed at offering products and services of the highest quality at prices among the lowest in the world to enhance the quality of life as well as the ease of living of hundreds of millions of Indians. ‚Ä¢ Reliance marked the milestone of having cumulatively invested more than $150 billion (over Rs 12 lakh crore) in the last 10 years ‚Äî higher than any other corporate in India. ‚Ä¢ Reliance set up Jio Financial Services to accelerate the replication of India‚Äôs dazzling growth story in Bharat, by significantly increasing financial services penetration for each and every Indian with a digital-first approach and minimal cost of service. ‚Ä¢ JFS announced a JV with the world‚Äôs largest asset management company BlackRock to set up an asset management business to provide simple and trustworthy investment solutions in India. ‚Ä¢ Reliance‚Äôs Digital Services business under Jio unleashed the fastest rollout of 5G technology witnessed anywhere in the world, launched the Jio Bharat phone to make India 2G-mukt, launched JioAirFiber and demonstrated JioSpaceFiber to connect unconnected regions. Jio‚Äôs data traffic continued to rise in double-digits to cross 12 exabytes per month. ‚Ä¢ Reliance Retail achieved a $100 billion valuation milestone in three fundraising deals, in which marquee global investment firms QIA, ADIA, and KKR participated. RRVL is developing into a world-class institution, driving the transformation of the Indian retail sector and creating value for millions of customers and partners. ‚Ä¢ During 2023, Reliance revived natural gas production in KG-D6 block to 30MMSCMD, meeting ~30% of India‚Äôs production. After commissioning the R-Cluster and Satellite-Cluster projects in the last couple of years, this year Reliance commissioned the MJ Field ‚Äì one of the most complex and cost-efficient deep-water projects of this scale. ‚Ä¢ Reliance‚Äôs journey to transition its legacy O2C business into a sustainable and green, circular, and consumer integrated, chemicals and materials business gained momentum in 2023. o As the first leg of the transition, Reliance is creating the New Energy ecosystem of manufacturing Solar, Wind, Batteries, Hydrogen, and Bio-energy platforms o Secondly, Reliance is accelerating circularity and consumer integration, to deliver application-specific green products o Thirdly, with technology and innovation, it is turning the refinery at Jamnagar into a ‚ÄòChemicals and Materials Feedstock Production‚Äô engine. RIL started by converting some low-value refinery streams to recently launched highly specialised Halo-Butyl Rubber grades. ‚Ä¢ Reliance progressed with India‚Äôs first and world-class Carbon Fibre facility in Hazira, Gujarat, which will include carbon fibre and carbon fibre reinforced plastics, with an aim to be among the top three players globally. ‚Ä¢ Reliance remains focused on the fast-track execution of Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Manufacturing Complex at Jamnagar, which will host one of the largest, most technologically advanced, flexible, and most cost-competitive Solar giga factory globally, converting sand into Solar PV modules. Reliance has set eyes on a target to accelerate and enable the installation of at least 100 GW of renewable energy generation by 2030. ‚Ä¢ Reliance is setting up its Battery giga factory by 2026, which will manufacture battery chemicals, cells, and packs, leading all the way up to containerised energy storage solutions, and will include a Battery Recycling facility to deliver a truly integrated ecosystem. ‚Ä¢ The year 2023 also marked RIL‚Äôs emergence as India‚Äôs largest Bio-energy producer based on its indigenously developed technology. Reliance commissioned the commercial-scale Compressed Biogas (CBG) plant at Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, in addition to two demo units at Jamnagar. Reliance aims to establish 100 CBG plants in the next 5 years, consuming 5.5 million tonnes of agro-residue and organic waste, thereby mitigating nearly 2 million tonnes of carbon emissions. ‚Ä¢ Reliance‚Äôs Media & Entertainment business created a huge disruption last year, with JioCinema leading the way. More than 12 crore people watched the IPL final online making it the most-watched digital event globally and marking a tectonic shift in the way content is consumed in India. ‚Ä¢ The year 2023 also marked a transition in RIL‚Äôs leadership. Isha Ambani, Akash Ambani, and Anant Ambani joined the company‚Äôs Board of Directors and are set to work as one single team to provide leadership to the Reliance Group as a whole and with a holistic vision. ‚Ä¢ Bringing the best of the world to India as well as providing a world-class platform to showcase India‚Äôs prowess, craftsmanship, art and culture is one of the unique initiatives of Reliance. Furthering this aim, Reliance commissioned the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre, and the Jio World Plaza in Mumbai in 2023. Together with the Jio World Convention Centre, the Jio World Garden and Jio World Drive, they have created an all-encompassing destination for the Indians to experience the world‚Äôs best brands and performances. ‚Ä¢ Under the leadership of Smt Nita Ambani, Reliance Foundation continued to work tirelessly to make lives better for millions of Indians. Through its multifarious activities, Reliance Foundation has so far touched the lives of nearly 70 million Indians across 54,000 villages across all states.

Reliance Foundation has been dedicatedly spreading joy among children from disadvantaged communities around this time of the year for over a decade now. This year, ‚ÄòWe Care, We Volunteer ‚Äì Kahani Kala Khushi‚Äô has been an intensive effort to combine storytelling, culture and art for the children that the Foundation supports through numerous organisations. It was held in 25 cities, including Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Delhi, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Volunteers engaged children by telling age-appropriate stories that helped them imaginatively discover India and creatively express their ideas, through art, up on being motivated by these stories. The stories covered festivals, folk and tribal stories and the stories had origins in their states. As the campaign aims to sustain their interest in art, art kits and material along with story books were also provided to the children. The storytelling continued for children at Jio Presents Hamleys Wonderland on Thursday, and all the children indulged in fun-filled extravaganza with attractions including Ferris Wonder Eye, arcade games, carousel, WonderTheatre and much more.

They were sharing experiences at a multi-stakeholder conference ‚ÄòShaping Perspectives on Practise and Policy for Millets in India‚Äô, organised by Reliance Foundation here today. Policymakers, farmer representatives, development sector stakeholders, researchers and industry representatives echoed the need for greater collaboration, increased farmer-focused efforts, and deliberated successes and challenges from both practice and policy within India‚Äôs millet landscape. A publication, ‚ÄòFostering Resilience for Sustainability: Reliance Foundation's Millet Experiences‚Äô, that documents learnings from millet interventions in different states was released on the occasion. Fostering Resilience for Sustainability showcases end to end interventions that include making quality seed accessible to farmers, providing continued technical support, strengthening market linkages, empowering women‚Äôs agency and building awareness of millets. Speakers at the discussions included Raman Wadhwa, Director, NRLM; Dr Neelam Patel, Senior Advisor, NITI Aayog; Priyanka Singh, Chief of Rural Transformation, Reliance Foundation; Prof. Ruth DeFries, Columbia University; Prasoon Bhardwaj, Head of Staples, Reliance Retail; K P Kavitha, CEO, Kazhani Farmers Producer Co, TN (FPO); R K Tiwari, Asst Director, Dept. of Women and Child Development, Madhya Pradesh; Savitaben Vasava, millets farmer from Narmada, Gujarat. Senior policymakers, researchers, practitioners and agriculture experts participated in the event. Since 2010, Reliance Foundation has been focusing on sustainable agriculture and strengthening of food systems through a collaborative approach with various stakeholders. The work with millet small and marginal farmers is another step to build resilience in the face of changing climate while enhancing the nutritional status of communities. Having observed 2018 as its ‚ÄòNational Year of Millets‚Äô, India presented the proposal for the ‚ÄòInternational Year of Millets‚Äô (IYOM) in the United Nations. At the 75th General Assembly session of the UN in March 2021, the year 2023 was declared IYOM to increase global awareness of the benefits of consuming and growing millets. India is world‚Äôs largest millet producer and its average production of 16.93 million metric tons during 2019-22 was about 11% higher than the production during 2014-18. Though area under millet cultivation has reduced, productivity has markedly increased over the years. #reliancefoundation #millets",https://www.facebook.com/502689438663583/posts/683177417281450,,"Photos from Reliance Industries Limited's post",,https://d1fufsnuanxyqc.cloudfront.net/616466315092212_683177417281450,photo,,,85,70,5,10,2286953,0.00003716735761513245,-14.255767619516938,,0,0

This new innovation is a testimony to RIL's commitment in reducing plastic waste and supporting Circular Economy in India. RIL shipped its first batch of ISCC-Plus certified Circular Polymers, named CircuRepol‚Ñ¢ (Polypropylene) and CircuRelene‚Ñ¢ (Polyethylene). RIL paves the way in India by using new technology to recycle plastic by converting plastic waste into special Circular Polymers, thereby making a positive impact on the environment. RIL‚Äôs commitment to sustainability is demonstrated through its innovative methods like chemical recycling which help create a Circular Economy. The company firmly believes in finding smart solutions to reduce plastic waste and inspire others to join in this journey towards a greener future. CircuRepol‚Ñ¢ and CircuRelene‚Ñ¢ have been designed to lead the way in Circular Economy practices. RIL's Jamnagar refinery became the first refinery to get the important ISCC-Plus certification, proving that it can produce Circular Polymers through chemical recycling. The ISCC-Plus certification guarantees that traceability and rules are followed in making Circular Polymers. RIL has developed a technology that turns different types of plastic waste, including single use and multi-layered plastics, into pyrolysis oil. The company is working with trusted partners to increase the production of this oil and turn the yield into Circular Polymers. Chemical recycling has many benefits, including turning plastic waste into high-quality materials for new plastic. These materials can be used for packaging that comes into contact with food. #WeCare #RelianceInnovation #CircularEconomy #SustainableFuture",https://www.facebook.com/502689438663583/posts/689083386690853,,"·∫¢nh t·ª´ b√†i vi·∫øt c·ªßa Reliance Industries Limited",,https://d1fufsnuanxyqc.cloudfront.net/616466315092212_689083386690853,photo,,,63,49,3,11,2286574,0.000027552136952488744,-19.23276587522497,,0,0

Jayarani belonged to the households in Keelakulam village, Ramanathapuram district, Tamil Nadu, that relied on paddy cultivation and cattle rearing as primary sources of livelihood. Due to commercialization, they were compelled to use costly and harmful chemical fertilizers, resulting in soil degradation. Jayarani says, ‚ÄúFarming paddy was not profitable. Many a times, after standing for hours in long queues to buy expensive fertilizers, I had to return empty handed due to high market demand.‚Äù Her life changed when she came across Reliance Foundation's work in empowering the women of Mugavai Farmer Producer Company to improve soil health for better harvests. She signed up for their training program to master the skill of vermicomposting, learning from experts of the Madurai Agri Business Incubation Forum (MABIF). Under the leadership, the 25 women who attended the session achieved a significant improvement in soil health, while also reducing their input costs by shifting to vermicompost and manure from chemical fertilizers. This #WorldSoilDay, Reliance Foundation is proud to celebrate the success and journeys of women farmers like Jayarani, who have strengthened the adoption of climate-resilient and better soil conservation practices, enabling countless farmers to harvest a brighter tomorrow. #RelianceFoundation #SustainableFarming #RelianceFoundationTransformingLives",https://d1fufsnuanxyqc.cloudfront.net/616466315092212_675750191357506,photo,,,28,26,2,0,2287594,0.00001223993418412533,-43.300297754094316,,0,0
